People Sync

1. Fresh install, sync 2 people lists with all fields. Check everything is synced.

2. After initial sync, edit bio text, re-run sync with changes to at least every CTC field once. Check each field change
and that bios have been unchanged.

3. Repeat 2 with selection of fields set to NOT sync

4. Delete one people list, verify that previously synced records from that list are 'removed'.
Currently that means set to draft.

5. Re-add the people list removed in previous step. All records should re-attach and show up as before.

6. Remove one person from one of the lists in F1. Check that it is removed when syncing.

7. Add that removed person to the F1 list. Should be reattached and synced again.

8. Add a new person to F1 list, check that added when synced.

9. Add a new person to F1 list that will be attached to existing CTC person. Check that that attaches.

10. Remove one people list from list to sync. Add another new people list to sync. Remove one person from people list
that remains to be synced, then add 2 new people to that list, one to be attached, the other that is new. Check that this
 all behaves as expected.

11. Set sync groups to false. Move one person in CTC from one CTC group to another. Run sync and check that no group
changes.
